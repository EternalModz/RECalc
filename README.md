# RECalc
A reverse engineering calculator and converter!

After months of development, I’ve created an advanced converter tool that I’m really proud of. It’s designed to handle a wide range of conversions, including hexadecimal, binary, decimal, octal, Base32, and Base64, while also letting you reverse them back to readable text. You can input text or numbers, even complex math expressions, and the tool will validate, process, and display the results in real-time. Plus, it features a sleek, user-friendly interface with error handling and the ability to download your results for future use.

# Updates and Pull Requests
I'll update RECalc as needed in the future, but I don't plan on making frequent updates unless I have the energy to do so. If you have improvements or fixes, please fork the repository and submit pull requests! This tool can grow and thrive with contributions from the community, and your input is greatly appreciated!

# Dedication
This project is dedicated to Natasha (LordVirus) and MayhemModding. They have both been by my side for more than five years now, and I am forever grateful to have them as my friends.
